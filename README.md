## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox more effiently to implement layout. In this chjallenge I used row-gap to space out the sections as per the design. I also applied code organisation to logically group and comment the code to improve maintainablity.

### Continued development

I signed up for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) and am following the CSS learning path.

### Useful resources

- [Semantic markup for card blocks](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/188612/semantic-markup-for-card-blocks) - helped me to use semantic markup in a realistic context
- [Organizing your CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing) - This article helped me to apply code organisation to the CSS file.
